      Charities have much better accessibility to the money donated. Crypto is
      fast and transparent. Ultimately making the non-profits even more
      comfortable dealing with crypto than with the traditional way. Less than
      0.1% of the charities accept crypto, which means 99.9% of them need our
      help, and all of the causes they support need us too.
